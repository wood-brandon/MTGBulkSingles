# MTGBulkSingles

MTGBulkSingles is a .NET 8 console application for Magic: The Gathering players and collectors. It allows you to quickly fetch and compare prices for all cards in a decklist using the MTG Singles API. The tool supports both fetching the cheapest version of each card or all available versions, and outputs results to the console and CSV.

## Features

- Reads decklists in MTG Arena format.
- Fetches card prices and store links from the MTG Singles API.
- Optionally fetches all versions or only the cheapest version of each card.
- Outputs results to a CSV file for easy reference.
- Configurable settings via `settings.json` (created on first run).
- Optional delay between API requests to avoid rate limiting.

## Requirements

- .NET 8 SDK or newer
- Windows, Linux, or macOS

## Installation
          
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nzgamer41/MTGBulkSingles.git
cd MTGBulkSingles
```
 
3. Build the project:
```
dotnet build
```
    
## Usage

1. Prepare your decklist in MTG Arena format (plain text file).
2. Run the application from the command line (or drag 'n' drop your text file onto the EXE on Windows):
    `MTGBulkSingles.exe <path to decklist>`

(Note, on macOS and Linux the application will be called MTGBulkSingles, you can launch this from a Terminal the same way as Windows users would. You can also run `dotnet MTGBulkSingles.dll <path to decklist>` if .NET 8 is installed on your system.)

Example:
    ```
    MTGBulkSingles.exe mydeck.txt
    ```


3. On first run, a `settings.json` file will be created. You can edit this file to adjust options such as:
    - `printAllVersions`: `true` to print all versions, `false` for only the cheapest.
    - `useDelay`: `true` to add a delay between API requests (recommended).
    - `delayMilliseconds`: Number of milliseconds to wait between requests.
    - `matchNameExactly`: `true` to match card names exactly.
    - `includeArtCards`: `true` to include art cards in results.

4. The results will be displayed in the console and, if only the cheapest versions are fetched, saved as a CSV file named `<decklist>_found.csv`.

## Example settings.json

```
{ "printAllVersions": false, "matchNameExactly": true, "useDelay": true, "includeArtCards": false, "delayMilliseconds": 2000, "settingsVersion": 1 }
```

## Notes

- Disabling the delay (`useDelay: false`) may result in your IP being banned/ratelimited by the MTG Singles API. Use with caution.
- The application is intended for personal use and not for commercial scraping.
